## Dynamic Formation Planning and Control for Robot Soccer Game with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Behavioral Model

{% include video.liquid path="assets/video/robotsoccer.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true %}

The robot soccer game has been considered as an illustrative scenario to test the performance of research outcomes on multi-agent systems (MAS). While various algorithm has been developed for a robot soccer game and implemented in the RoboCup competition, relatively little collaboration can be found in existing results, e.g., the formation for passing and dribbling during the offense or the collaborative obstruction during defense, which are very common in the teamwork of human soccer game.
