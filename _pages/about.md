Welcome to the Intelligent Robotic Manipulation (IRM) Lab at Tsinghua University! Our mission is to advance dexterous and intelligent robotic manipulation capabilities, which are essential for enabling robots to effectively interact with and assist humans in real-world environments. To achieve this, we focus on solutions driven by breakthrough learning techniques and real-time optimization methods. We apply these solutions to several challenging scenarios, including deformable object manipulation, in-hand manipulation, human-robot co-manipulation (including exoskeleton systems), and micromanipulation (within the framework of multi-agent systems). By addressing open issues in these areas, we aim to bridge the gap between simulation and reality and lay the foundation for the practical and stable implementation of robotic manipulation.
